Distribution doesn’t work on the public-facing version, Cash POS is incomplete, and the Checkers system is broken. This next time around, fully overhaul the entire system.
Start with Ruby Station:

When importing a CSV, make it smart—match or closely match column names to expected fields and autofill dropdowns based on best guesses.

The scanner under Ruby is perfect but needs to auto-focus the “Enter or scan student ID” textbox when the page loads.

Cash POS: Fully remake it from scratch.

Form should include:

Student ID

First Name

Last Name

Amount of cash given

Price (default to 90, but editable)

On submit, show a modal:

“Sale Entered”

Show ID, first/last name, order date, balance due

Show change owed and break it down by bill denominations

Free Book Management:

Label: “Issue a complimentary book to someone without requiring payment.”

Two fields: First Name and Last Name

Auto-assign ID: 0000000

Auto-generate a sale number

Set Order Type: FREE

System Logs tab:

Fix "Filter by Action Type"—make it work by inserting a corresponding string into the "Search logs..." textbox automatically

Student Database Overhaul:

Rename to: Database

Move Quick Actions section above the main table

Paginate the list: 50 entries per page

Change “Add new student” button to: “Add new entry”

Add the Checkers system to Ruby Station (which is the one that when any distribution is made, it should pop up there in a table with litterally just a name, first and last, and a button to click "confirm" and when confirmed, they go to the "confirmed" tab inside of that one.

Then copy each system created in Ruby (Scanning, Cash, Checkers) individually into the other stations so each has their own functional version.

Every single detail above is important—nothing should be skipped or left out under any circumstances. Follow the entire prompt exactly.
Also, logging out is broken, when you click log out your still logged in in the top right. please fix this.
